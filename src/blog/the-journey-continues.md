brief: The second test article of a static markdown blog
---

Two test articles? With little imagination, but yes there they are in the `blog` folder.

You need a couple more tools to tie it up all together:

1. a way to process **markdown** documents into nice and easy to render <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>

2. a way to process the _frontmatter_ at the very top of the page

Just be sure to skip the frontmatter for the HTML.
